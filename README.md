nodejs_steambot
===============
This is my attempt at implemeting a steam bot using the steam and steam-trade modules

# Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:jacobtruman/nodejs_steambot.git
npm install
```

#Usage
```
node trade_offers.js username
```

The "configfile.json" needs to be in the "configs" directory. The name of the file needs to be the steam login. You can find a sample config file in the root of this project
