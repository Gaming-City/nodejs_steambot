nodejs_steambot
===============
This is my attempt at implemeting a steam bot using the steam and steam-trade modules

Usage:
node index.js username

The "configfile.json" needs to be in the "configs" directory. The name of the file needs to be the steam login. You can find a sample config file in the root of this project
